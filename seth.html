                The eponymous founder of Vivienne Taa label is a very new but great addition to the Kenyan fashion industry. She took up fashion as a hobby while working for Kenya Airways. When she was let go in 2016, fashion was not just a fall back plan, it was her passion, so she took to it with gusto. Within a few months, her label was showcasing her designs on major runways in Kenya including The Nairobi Fashion Week. The label exudes elegance, heavily incorporating the African culture.
