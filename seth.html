                The eponymous founder of Vivienne Taa label is a very new but great addition to the Kenyan fashion industry. She took up fashion as a hobby while working for Kenya Airways. When she was let go in 2016, fashion was not just a fall back plan, it was her passion, so she took to it with gusto. Within a few months, her label was showcasing her designs on major runways in Kenya including The Nairobi Fashion Week. The label exudes elegance, heavily incorporating the African culture.

                Patricia Mbela is a household name in the Kenyan fashion scene. Her brand, Poisa, produces both men and women’s collections, including a knitwear line and jewellery. Her ‘Wearable Art’, as she likes to call it, has been showcased all over the world. Perhaps her most notable work is the Kenya Airways Millennium uniform design, selected from hundreds of others in a competition. Among many other awards, she was awarded the 2014 Top Kenyan Fashion and Jewellery Designer at the Kenyan Fashion Week.
